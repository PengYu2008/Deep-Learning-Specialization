# Course1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
The first course for [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).


## Objectives:

1. Be familiar with Python(mainly Numpy). For python tutorials, you can also check [here](https://github.com/zyunsg/Python).
2. 
3. 

## Assignments:

* [week2](https://github.com/zyunsg/deep-learning/tree/master/course1/week2)
